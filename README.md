# CSV representation of array
Create a function that returns the CSV representation of a two-dimensional numeric array.

Example:

input:
   [[ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ],
    [ 10,11,12,13,14 ],
    [ 20,21,22,23,24 ],
    [ 30,31,32,33,34 ]] 
    
output:
     '0,1,2,3,4\n'
    +'10,11,12,13,14\n'
    +'20,21,22,23,24\n'
    +'30,31,32,33,34'



# Multiply the number

Jack really likes his number five: the trick here is that you have to multiply each number by 5 raised to the number of digits of each numbers, so, for example:

  3 -->    15  (  3 * 5¹)
 10 -->   250  ( 10 * 5²)
200 --> 25000  (200 * 5³)
  0 -->     0  (  0 * 5¹)
 -3 -->   -15  ( -3 * 5¹)
